      <p>Black holes are regions in space with gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.</p></center>

        <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
          <li>Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity.</li>
          <li>There are different types of black holes: stellar, supermassive, and intermediate.</li>
          <li>The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape.</li>
          <li>Supermassive black holes are believed to exist at the center of most galaxies.</li>
          <li>Black holes can be detected by observing the effects of their gravitational pull on nearby objects.</li>
          <li>The size of a black hole is determined by its event horizon, known as the Schwarzschild radius.</li>
          <li>Time slows down near a black hole due to the immense gravitational field.</li>
          <li>Black holes are not empty; they contain an enormous amount of mass.</li>
          <li>Scientists use various methods, including gravitational waves, to study black holes.</li>
          <li>Theories about black holes were first proposed by Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity.</li>
