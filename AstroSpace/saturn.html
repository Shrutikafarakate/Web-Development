    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system. Known for its stunning ring system, Saturn is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
      <li>Saturn's rings are made mostly of ice particles, with traces of rock and dust.</li>
      <li>It has 82 known moons, with Titan being the largest and more massive than Mercury.</li>
      <li>Saturn's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane and ammonia.</li>
      <li>The planet's magnetic field is about 578 times stronger than Earth's.</li>
      <li>Saturn's equatorial diameter is about 120,536 km, making it over nine times wider than Earth.</li>
      <li>It takes Saturn approximately 10.7 hours to complete one rotation on its axis.</li>
      <li>Saturn's average distance from the Sun is about 1.4 billion kilometers (9.5 AU).</li>
      <li>The planet has a low density; it would float in water if there were a body of water large enough to contain it.</li>
      <li>Saturn's rings are gradually disappearing due to a phenomenon known as "ring rain." :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</li>
      <li>Observing Saturn at opposition provides the best view, as the planet is closest to Earth and fully illuminated by the Sun. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</li>
