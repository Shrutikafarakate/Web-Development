      <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and has a thick toxic atmosphere. It’s the hottest planet.</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar size and composition. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</li>
        <li>It has a diameter of approximately 12,104 km, slightly smaller than Earth's. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</li>
        <li>Venus has no moons or rings. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
        <li>The planet's surface temperature averages around 462°C (864°F), hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
        <li>Venus has a retrograde rotation, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most planets, including Earth. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
        <li>A day on Venus (one full rotation) is longer than its year (one full orbit around the Sun). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        <li>The planet's atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
        <li>Venus is the third-brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
        <li>Despite its extreme conditions, Venus may have had liquid water in the past and could have supported life billions of years ago. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
        <li>Venus has been a target for numerous space missions, including NASA's Magellan spacecraft, which mapped its surface in the 1990s. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
