      <p>Stars are massive luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity. They emit light and heat, and our Sun is the closest star to Earth.</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Stars are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
        <li>They form in nebulae, which are vast clouds of gas and dust.</li>
        <li>The color of a star indicates its temperature; blue stars are the hottest, while red stars are cooler.</li>
        <li>Stars undergo a life cycle, evolving from protostars to main sequence stars, and eventually to red giants or supernovae.</li>
        <li>Our Sun is a middle-aged star, approximately 4.6 billion years old.</li>
        <li>There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the Earth's beaches.</li>
        <li>Many stars exist in binary or multiple star systems, orbiting each other due to gravitational attraction.</li>
        <li>Some stars, like Betelgeuse, are supergiants and are among the largest known stars.</li>
        <li>When massive stars explode in supernovae, they can outshine entire galaxies for a short period.</li>
        <li>Neutron stars, the remnants of supernovae, are incredibly dense and have strong magnetic fields.</li>
