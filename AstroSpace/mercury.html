      <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our Solar System. It experiences extreme temperatures due to its very thin atmosphere.</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System.</li>
        <li>It has no moons or rings.</li>
        <li>Mercury's surface temperatures range from -173°C at night to 427°C during the day.</li>
        <li>A year on Mercury lasts only 88 Earth days.</li>
        <li>It has a large metallic core, making it the second densest planet after Earth.</li>
        <li>Mercury's surface is covered with craters, similar to Earth's Moon.</li>
        <li>The planet has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen.</li>
        <li>Mercury exhibits a phenomenon called "spin-orbit resonance," rotating three times for every two orbits around the Sun.</li>
        <li>Despite being closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet; Venus holds that title.</li>
        <li>NASA's MESSENGER mission provided detailed information about Mercury's composition and magnetic field.</li>
