      <p>Comets are icy celestial objects that release gas and dust when they approach the Sun, forming a glowing tail visible from Earth.</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Comets are made primarily of ice, dust, and rocky material.</li>
        <li>They originate in the outer parts of the solar system, such as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.</li>
        <li>When near the Sun, the ice in comets vaporizes, creating a glowing coma and tail.</li>
        <li>The tail of a comet always points away from the Sun due to solar wind.</li>
        <li>Comets have highly elliptical orbits, bringing them close to the Sun and then far out again.</li>
        <li>Famous comets include Halley's Comet, which is visible from Earth approximately every 76 years.</li>
        <li>Comet nuclei are typically only a few kilometers wide.</li>
        <li>Their bright appearances in the night sky have been recorded by many ancient civilizations.</li>
        <li>Scientists study comets to learn about the early solar system since they are made of primordial material.</li>
        <li>Space missions like ESA's Rosetta have provided valuable close-up data about comets.</li>
